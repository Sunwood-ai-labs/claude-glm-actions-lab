# Logo Prompt

```
Logo design for an open-source repository named "claude glm actions lab". Make it EXTRA pop, energetic, and cute while still clean enough for a GitHub OSS project. Create playful rounded typography with bright, flat pastel-rainbow colors and a bouncy, springy feel. Use bold, smooth, chunky letterforms with a slightly wiggly baseline and subtle variation in letter heights (fun and lively, but still highly legible).

Make "claude" the main focus in big bouncy letters, with multi-color lettering (each letter a different pastel accent, or alternating colors). Make "glm" a compact secondary tag in a small rounded capsule (solid pastel fill with dark text), and "actions lab" as a friendly light-weight subtitle beneath, with slightly rounded corners and generous tracking for readability.

Add a playful flat icon integrated with the wordmark that communicates automation/workflows + experimentation: combine a tiny rounded flow/nodes motif with a small flask or spark/bolt. Keep everything geometric, rounded, and minimal, but cute—like sticker-style vector graphics. Add more pop doodles around the text (8–12 small elements): tiny stars, circles, triangles, sparkles, dots, and mini curved motion lines in pastel rainbow colors. Arrange doodles to frame the logo like confetti, avoiding clutter and keeping clear negative space around the wordmark.

Maintain a clean centered layout on a white background with generous spacing. Flat vector only. No 3D, no gradients, no shadows, no outlines. Crisp edges, balanced proportions, high contrast for small-size readability. Overall impression: vibrant, playful, friendly, premium "dev-tool meets pop-sticker" OSS identity.
