# Release Note Header Prompt

```
Logo design for an open-source repository named "claude glm actions lab". Blend a modern developer-tool aesthetic with a playful, pop, bouncy feel (like modern kids-brand energy, but still suitable for GitHub). Create playful rounded typography with bold, smooth, bouncy letterforms. Make "claude" the primary word in a chunky rounded sans with a friendly bounce. Make "glm" a compact secondary tag (slightly smaller) and "actions lab" a light-weight subtitle for hierarchy and clarity.

Use bright but tasteful flat colors: pastel-rainbow accents plus neutral dark text for readability. Make "claude" colorful (multi-color or alternating accent letters) while keeping "glm" and "actions lab" mostly neutral/dark for contrast and clarity. Add the version text "v1.1.0" in a cute, polished rounded pill/badge placed at the top-right of "claude" (or as a tiny pill after "actions lab"). The badge should use an accent color with white text (or white badge with accent text), subtle and readable at small sizes.

Add a simple flat icon integrated with the wordmark that suggests automation/workflows + experimentation, but keep it playful: a rounded node-and-connector motif, a tiny bolt/play mark, or a minimal flask, all in flat pastel colors. Add small geometric doodles around the logo (tiny circles, triangles, stars, dots) in pastel rainbow colors—sparingly, to keep a clean minimal layout. Use generous whitespace and a centered composition on a white background.

No 3D, no gradients, no shadows, no outlines. Flat vector style only, crisp edges, rounded geometry, premium and friendly. Overall impression: modern OSS dev identity with a pop, energetic, approachable vibe.
